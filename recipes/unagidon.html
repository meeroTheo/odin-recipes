        <h3 id="desc">Unagi Rice Bowl</h3>
        <p><strong>Unagi</strong> is the Japanese word for 'eel',
            and this particular one-bowl donburi
            dish tops servings of white rice with
            fillets of freshly grilled eel, all
            seasoned with a homemade unagi sauce.
            Prepare on the barbecue during a hot
            summer's day, or make on an oven grill
            in the evening.</p>

        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sauce, combine the mirin
                and sake in a small saucepan and bring
                to the boil. Reduce the heat and add the
                sugar, stirring until completely dissolved.
                Add the soy sauce and bring to the boil.
                Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 mins, or
                until the sauce thickens. Turn off the heat
                and set aside to cool</li>
            <li>While the sauce is cooling, start cooking and
                preparing the rice using your preferred method.
                We suggest using 200g rice and 260ml water after
                washing the rice</li>
            <li>Preheat your grilling unit to high (about 250Â°C).
                Normally eel fillets come sliced in half lengthwise,
                so cut your eel fillets in half width-wise so they can
                fit on top of your rice bowl. Line a baking sheet with
                aluminium foil. Lay the fillets on top and brush with
                vegetable oil. Place on the grilling unit and grill for
                5-7 minutes, or until nicely browned</li>
            <li>Take the fillets out of the oven and carefully brush with
                the unagi sauce, leaving a little sauce for later. Place the
                fillets back on the grilling unit to grill for a further
                minute or so, until the sauce starts to bubble on top.</li>
            <li>To serve, Add a serving of cooked rice to an empty bowl.
                Brush the top of the rice with the remaining sauce and lay
                the unagi fillets on top.</li>
